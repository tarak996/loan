# Credit Scoring and Loan Application System

## Overview

This system calculates and processes credit scores for loan applicants, enabling a secure and automated loan application process. It provides APIs for registering users, applying for loans, and reviewing loan statuses, all while utilizing **Flask** for backend processing, **MongoDB** for data storage, and a simple **HTML/CSS** frontend.
